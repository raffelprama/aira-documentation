# Welcome to AIRA

**AIRA** is your intelligent assistant for managing alerts and incidents. By combining the power of AI with automated workflows, AIRA helps your team diagnose problems faster, reduce manual work, and build a smarter, more resilient operation.

## What AIRA Does for You

AIRA is designed to handle common, repetitive tasks so your team can focus on what matters most.

* **Reduces Alert Fatigue**: Instead of getting countless pings for a simple issue, AIRA automatically investigates and resolves it, notifying you only when a human is truly needed.
* **Accelerates Resolution**: By instantly analyzing alerts and suggesting solutions, AIRA helps you fix problems in minutes, not hours.
* **Builds a Smarter Team**: Every time you provide feedback, AIRA learns. Over time, your knowledge turns into an automated runbook that improves every incident.

## How It Works (At a Glance)
1.  **Alert**: An alert comes in from your monitoring tool (e.g., a alertmanager).
2.  **Analyze**: AIRA immediately goes to work, using AI to investigate the root cause.
3.  **Act**: If it finds a solution, AIRA can take action to fix the problem automatically.
4.  **Notify**: AIRA sends a clear, easy-to-read message to Slack with its findings and what it has done.
5.  **Learn**: Your team provides simple feedback, which AIRA uses to improve its future responses.
