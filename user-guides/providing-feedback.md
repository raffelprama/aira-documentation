# Providing Feedback to Train AIRA

AIRA isn't a static tool—it's a system that learns and gets smarter every time you use it. Your simple feedback is the most powerful way to improve its accuracy and make it more effective for your team.

### The Feedback Loop

The process of training AIRA is a simple, two-step loop.

**1. Your Input:**
After AIRA sends a diagnosis and recommendation to Slack, your job is to provide simple feedback. This can be as easy as clicking a "Correct" or "Incorrect" button, or by replying in the thread with a short message explaining what happened.

**2. AIRA's Learning:**
Every piece of feedback you provide is logged and analyzed. This data helps AIRA recognize patterns, refine its diagnoses, and adjust its future actions to be more precise. It's like teaching a new team member how your specific systems and common issues work.

### Why Your Feedback Matters

Providing feedback might seem small, but its impact is huge.

* **Builds Your Own AI Runbook**: Over time, your feedback creates a customized knowledge base. This means AIRA will begin to handle more complex or unique problems for your specific environment automatically.
* **Increases Automation**: The more accurate AIRA becomes, the more tasks it can automate on its own, freeing up your team's time for more important work.
* **Saves Time in the Future**: A few seconds of feedback now can prevent a future incident from ever needing your attention again.

By actively participating in this feedback loop, you are turning every incident into an opportunity for your team to get smarter and more efficient.
