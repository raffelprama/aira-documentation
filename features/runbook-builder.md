# Automated Runbooks: Building a Knowledge Base

A runbook is a set of instructions for solving a known problem. Traditionally, they are difficult to maintain and often become outdated. AIRA changes that by building your runbooks automatically.

### The Problem with Manual Runbooks

Your team is busy, and manually documenting every incident and solution is a huge effort. This can lead to:

* **Outdated Information**: Runbooks often fall out of sync with your real-world systems.
* **Wasted Time**: Teams spend time re-solving the same problems instead of finding a central solution.
* **Knowledge Silos**: The knowledge of how to fix an issue lives in one person's head, not in a shared, accessible document.

### How AIRA Builds Your Runbooks

AIRA turns every incident into a learning opportunity, automating the runbook creation process with your help.

1.  **Experience**: An incident occurs, and AIRA diagnoses and takes action to resolve it.
2.  **Feedback**: You confirm that AIRA's solution was correct by providing positive feedback (either by not flagging it or by a specific confirmation).
3.  **Automation**: AIRA then understands that this solution is effective for this specific problem. It saves all the details—the alert, the diagnosis, the actions, and the solution—as a new, automated runbook.

The next time that same issue occurs, AIRA already has a proven, reliable solution.

### Key Benefits

* **Effortless Creation**: You don't have to write a single document. Your team builds a comprehensive knowledge base just by doing their normal work.
* **Always Up-to-Date**: Because runbooks are built directly from real-world incidents, they are always accurate and reflect the current state of your systems.
* **Knowledge is Shared**: The knowledge to solve a problem is no longer siloed. It is saved in an automated runbook that anyone can reference.
