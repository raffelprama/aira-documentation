# Ticket Automation: Seamlessly Integrated

AIRA doesn't just diagnose and solve problems; it also works with your existing tools to automate your entire workflow, including ticket management.

### The Automated Ticket Process

From the moment an alert is detected, AIRA ensures that every step of the incident is properly documented without any manual effort.

1.  **Ticket Creation**: The moment an alert comes in, AIRA automatically creates a new ticket in your chosen ticketing system.
2.  **Rich Information**: The new ticket isn't empty. AIRA automatically populates it with all the key information: the alert summary, the root cause diagnosis, and any actions it plans to take. This saves your team from having to manually copy-paste details from logs.
3.  **Real-time Updates**: As AIRA works to resolve the issue, it updates the ticket in real-time. Every action it takes and every insight it gathers is added to the ticket log, creating a full and accurate history of the incident.
4.  **Automatic Closure**: When the incident is fully resolved and the system returns to normal, AIRA automatically closes the ticket, marking the incident as complete.

### Key Benefits

* **Effortless Documentation**: Your team can focus on solving problems, not on creating and updating tickets.
* **More Complete Records**: Tickets are richer and more accurate because they contain all the diagnostic information from AIRA's analysis.
* **A Full Automated Workflow**: The entire process, from a noisy alert to a closed ticket, is handled automatically, saving your team valuable time and ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.
